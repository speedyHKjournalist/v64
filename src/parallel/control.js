// (docs/multicore.md): an Int32Array over a
// SharedArrayBuffer of its own. Guest RAM and CPU state live in the Wasm
// memory; this block only carries the host protocol:
//
// - stop-the-world: the machine raises STOP to a new epoch and kicks every
//   core; a core acknowledges at its next safe point (between slices, or
//   while it waits halted) by writing the epoch to its ACK word, then waits
//   for RESUME to reach the same epoch and runs the COMMAND left for it;
// - I/O: a core in a worker posts a port or MMIO access in its slot, rings
//   DOORBELL and waits; the machine performs it on the devices' thread;
// - status words the machine reads for diagnostics and scheduling.
