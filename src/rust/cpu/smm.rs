//! System management mode, for the Q35 machine: the ICH9 raises SMIs from
//! the APM control port and the TCO watchdog (src/acpi.js), the local APICs
//! deliver SMI messages (IPIs, MSIs, IOAPIC entries). crate::cpu::apic
//! latches an SMI per core; handle_irqs takes it while the core is not in
//! SMM, so one that comes in SMM waits for RSM.
//!
//! An SMI saves the CPU state at SMBASE + 0xFE00 in a layout of QEMU's
//! target/i386/tcg/system/smm_helper.c: the 32-bit one (revision 0x20000)
//! with the legacy CPU profile, the 64-bit one (revision 0x20064) with the
//! x86-64 profile, in every mode, as AMD64 and Intel 64 processors do.
//! SeaBIOS's SMI handler reads and edits both (src/fw/smm.c: the SMBASE
//! relocation and call32_smm). The handler starts at SMBASE + 0x8000 in real
//! mode with 4 GiB segment limits, without paging (and long mode: EFER is
//! cleared). RSM restores the state, and a new SMBASE from the save area.
//!
//! SMRAM, as the Q35 MCH decodes it (src/q35.js passes its controls):
//! - compatible SMRAM, the RAM behind the VGA window (0xA0000-0xBFFFF): in SMM
//!   with G_SMRAME (D_CLS keeps data accesses on the VGA window then, but not
//!   instruction fetches), and for everyone while software opened it (D_OPEN);
//! - high SMRAM (ESMRAMC.H_SMRAME): instead of that, the same RAM at
//!   0xFEDA0000-0xFEDBFFFF, under the same conditions (SMBASE may point there);
//! - TSEG, the top of the RAM below 4 GiB (ESMRAMC.T_EN with G_SMRAME): RAM in
//!   SMM; elsewhere it reads as all ones and ignores writes.
//! Those addresses stay mapped (crate::cpu::memory's out-of-line paths
//! decide; TSEG lowers the fast RAM limit, and the x64 bus decodes it,
//! crate::x64::physical), so nothing in them is cached or compiled.
//!
//! An SMI that interrupts HLT sets the auto HALT restart field of the save
//! area; RSM returns to the halt state if the handler left it set. Not
//! supported: the I/O instruction restart field (cleared at the SMI, ignored
//! by RSM), and ESMRAMC.E_SMERR, as in QEMU.
