//! Host-parallel execution (docs/multicore.md).
//!
//! build/v86-parallel.wasm runs one instance per vCPU in one shared memory
//! (src/parallel/relocate.js). The machine instance, at base 0, runs the
//! bootstrap processor and owns the devices; each application processor runs
//! in a worker with its own relocated copy of the module. A static therefore
//! belongs to one instance, unless it is reached through `machine()`, which
//! maps a static of this instance to the same static of the machine instance:
//! the local APICs, the IOAPIC, the INIT/SIPI/NMI latches, the physical bus
//! and the code page counts are machine state accessed that way.
//!
//! Guest RAM is shared. In the parallel build every aligned access to it is a
//! sequentially consistent atomic (x86 TSO needs ordered loads and stores on
//! weakly ordered hosts), read-modify-write instructions commit with a
//! compare-exchange, and unaligned accesses are fenced on both sides. The
//! normal build compiles these helpers to plain memory accesses.
