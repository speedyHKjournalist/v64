// Layout of the CPU state at fixed addresses in the Wasm memory (below Rust's
// --global-base, 4096), and who owns each piece of CPU-related state.
//
// This is the single source for
//   src/rust/cpu/global_pointers.rs  the constants between the GENERATED markers
//   src/state_layout.js              offsets and per-core ranges for JavaScript
// Regenerate with `node gen/state_layout.js`; `--check` fails if either file is
// stale, a field overlaps another, or a Rust static is missing from STATICS.
//
// Owners (docs/multicore.md):
//   core     architectural state of one core: copied when the active core
//            changes and saved in snapshots
//   cache    derived from core state; dropped or recomputed when the active
//            core changes (see CPU.prototype.load_core_state)
//   scratch  only live inside one instruction, helper or generated-code
//            activation; never live at a main-loop safe point
//   machine  shared by all cores (devices, configuration, JIT caches that are
//            re-validated against the live TLB and CPU state on every use)
//   debug    diagnostics and profiling counters
//
// A core field may name a `range`: the per-core snapshot ranges
// (CORE_STATE_RANGES) never merge fields of different ranges, so state added
// later gets a range of its own, which snapshots from before it lack (and
// restore to reset values). `init: "keep"` marks core state that INIT leaves
// alone (INIT_PRESERVED); INIT resets the rest.
