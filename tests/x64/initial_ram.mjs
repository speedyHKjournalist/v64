// Guest RAM reads as zero until something writes it, whatever the wasm heap
// it is allocated from held before (cpu/memory.rs allocate_memory). With
// Tier-0, ir::runtime::schedule's reserve_compiler_heap frees 16 chunks of
// 2 MiB just before RAM is allocated in their place, and their allocator
// headers used to show up in guest RAM: 0x0020000A00400010 at 0x3FFEA0
// (reported as an x64 page tier write: no guest touched it), a header every
// 2 MiB and the heap's former end marker every 2 MiB + 64 KiB; in every
// configuration, the initial heap's end marker (0x28 at 0x9FDC). Checked in
// each configuration: before the first instruction, all of RAM is zero but
// the multiboot image; after a long-mode guest ran a loop (compiled by the
// page tier), RAM from 0x300000 to its end is zero but the guest's marker.
// With Tier-0, 32 MiB of RAM lies within the memory the heap had used, and
// 64 MiB extends past it.
