# Custom virtio devices

The `virtio_devices` option adds virtio PCI devices that are implemented
outside of v86. v86 provides the transport:

- the PCI function and its capabilities;
- feature negotiation and the virtqueues;
- the interrupt;
- the transport's part of a saved state.

The descriptor provides what the device does. This is how a device with its
own guest driver can live in a separate project.

Descriptors run on the CPU's thread, so `virtio_devices` cannot be combined
with `cpu_worker`. Device plugins can: `graphics_proxy` is one. Its device
runs in the worker and talks to the page over a channel; see
[glbridge.md](glbridge.md).

## Example: an entropy device

Linux's `virtio_rng` driver reads random bytes from device type 4 (PCI device
ID 0x1044). `tests/devices/virtio_rng.js` boots Linux with this device and
reads it from `/dev/hwrng`.

```js
let device;
const rng = {
    name: "rng",
    device_id: 0x1044,
    subsystem_device_id: 4,
    queues: [{ size: 8 }],
    init(handle) { device = handle; },
    notify(queue) {
        let request;
        while((request = device.pop_request(queue))) {
            request.write(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(request.writable)));
            request.complete();
        }
        device.flush(queue);
    },
};

const emulator = new V86({
    graphics_adapter: "bochs_vga",
    // ...
    virtio_devices: [rng],
});
```

## The descriptor

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `name` | Unique among the devices; its part of a saved state is stored under this name |
| `device_id`, `subsystem_device_id` | PCI IDs; the vendor is always 0x1AF4 |
| `pci_slot` | Optional (1 to 31). By default, the first free slot from 0x10. A stable slot matters to guests that remember devices by location, such as Windows |
| `io_base` | Optional base of four 256-byte I/O windows. By default, allocated from 0xE000 |
| `features` | Device feature bits. `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` (32) is always added |
| `queues` | `[{ size }]`, with sizes that are powers of two |
| `config` | Optional device configuration space, at most 256 bytes: `[{ bytes: 1, 2 or 4, read(), write(value) }]` |
| `init(handle)` | Called once, after the PCI function exists |
| `notify(queue)` | The driver made requests available. Only called after the driver has set DRIVER_OK |
| `reset()` | The driver reset the device, or the machine was reset |
| `get_state()`, `set_state(state)` | The device's part of a saved state. Synchronous. Numbers, strings, arrays and typed arrays only, no plain objects |
| `busy()` | Optional: the work the device still waits for from elsewhere. Before a snapshot, the CPU worker waits until this is 0 |
| `upgrade_state(slot)` | Optional: recognizes `state[92]` of a snapshot from before custom devices, and returns `[transport state, device state, host state]` or `null` |

Descriptors are read with their field names as written, so they work with
both `libv86.js` and the Closure-compiled `v86_all.js`.

A slot or I/O window that is already taken is an error. So are two devices
with the same name.

## The handle

| Method | |
|---|---|
| `pop_request(queue)` | The next request, or `null` |
| `has_request(queue)` | |
| `flush(queue)` | Publishes the completed requests and raises the interrupt |
| `read_memory(address, length)`, `write_memory(bytes, address)` | Guest RAM, plain or extended, anywhere on the 36-bit bus. Anything else, such as device memory or the legacy VGA/ROM range, throws a `RangeError`. A read returns a view where one contiguous backing holds the range, and a copy otherwise. Writes invalidate compiled code |
| `is_ram(address, length)` | |
| `is_ready()` | DRIVER_OK is set, and neither the driver nor the device has failed |
| `is_feature_negotiated(bit)` | |
| `needs_reset()` | Tells the driver the device has failed |
| `config_changed()` | Tells the driver the configuration space changed |

A request has these members:

- `readable` and `writable`: the byte counts of its buffers;
- `read()`: returns the bytes the driver wrote;
- `write(bytes)`: writes the reply;
- `complete()`: hands the request back. It becomes visible to the driver on
  the next `flush`.

A request can be completed later, for example after asynchronous work. If the
device is reset or a state is restored in between, `write` and `complete` do
nothing.

Rings and buffers must be in guest RAM. If they are not, the driver is told to
reset the device, and `pop_request` returns `null`.

## Saved states

A saved state holds each device's transport state and its `get_state()`,
under the device's name. Restoring such a state needs a device with the same
name, and throws otherwise. A device the state does not know about is reset.
Machines without custom devices save exactly what they saved before.
A `state[92]` written before custom devices existed goes to the device whose
`upgrade_state` recognizes it.
