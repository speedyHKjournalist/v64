# Graphics proxy quick start

## 1. What is the graphics proxy?

A custom virtio device (`v86gl`) receives the graphics commands of the Windows
guest's driver and passes them to a renderer in the browser, which uses WebGPU.
Neither is part of v86 itself: both are in the graphics bundle
`build/glbridge/libv86-webgpu.js` (`make glbridge`), and v86 hosts the device
through its `virtio_devices` API
(see [custom-virtio-devices.md](custom-virtio-devices.md)).

- [`src/browser/glbridge/v86gl_device.js`](../src/browser/glbridge/v86gl_device.js):
  the device, next to the CPU (the page, or the CPU worker)
- [`src/browser/glbridge/graphics_proxy.js`](../src/browser/glbridge/graphics_proxy.js):
  the renderer's side, with the hooks v86 calls around saves and restores

Load the bundle after `libv86.js` and turn the proxy on:

```html
<script src="libv86.js"></script>
<script src="libv86-webgpu.js"></script>
```

```js
new V86({
    screen_container: document.getElementById("screen_container"),
    graphics_adapter: "bochs_vga",   // the display hardware; required
    graphics_proxy: true,            // or options, e.g. { onError }
    // ...
});
```

In `index.html` or `debug.html`, enable **Enable graphics proxy (WebGPU)**.

With `cpu_worker: true` the device runs in the CPU worker, which loads it from
`v86gl-device.js` beside `libv86-webgpu.js` (`make glbridge` builds both;
deploy them together, or pass `graphics_proxy: { workerScript }`). Across the
worker boundary at most 8 batches (32 MiB) are in flight; the guest waits for
the renderer beyond that.

## 2. Get the driver and DLLs

Sources and binaries are in
[retro-gaming-site/glbridge](https://github.com/speedyHKjournalist/retro-gaming-site/tree/main/glbridge):

- `v86gl_driver/v86gl-virtio.sys`
- `openglproxy/opengl32.dll`
- `ddrawproxy/ddraw.dll`
- `d3d8proxy/d3d8.dll`
- `d3d9proxy/d3d9.dll`

## 3. Install the driver in Windows 2000/XP

Rename `v86gl-virtio.sys` to `v86gl.sys` and copy it to
`C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers`. When updating, close the game and run
`sc stop v86gl` before replacing the file.

Run these commands as Administrator:

```bat
sc create v86gl type= kernel start= demand binPath= C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\v86gl.sys

sc qc v86gl
sc start v86gl
```

The current build scripts target XP; Windows 2000 compatibility is unverified.

## 4. Install the graphics DLLs

Copy the DLLs needed by the game into the same folder as its `.exe`:
`opengl32.dll` for OpenGL, `ddraw.dll` for DirectDraw, `d3d8.dll` for Direct3D 8,
or `d3d9.dll` for Direct3D 9.

## 5. Build the driver and DLLs

Install the 32-bit MinGW-w64 toolchain (`i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`, `objdump`, and
`windres`), including its DDK headers and kernel import libraries.
From the `retro-gaming-site` repository root, run:

```sh
sh glbridge/v86gl_driver/build.sh
sh glbridge/openglproxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/ddrawproxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/d3d8proxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/d3d9proxy/build.sh
```


## 6. Tested games and applications

The following games and applications have been tested with the graphics proxy:

- **OpenGL:** GLView 2.6.0, Warcraft III (OpenGL mode), Cube 2 Sauerbraten.
- **DirectDraw:** 3DMark 99 MAX, Diablo II.
- **Direct3D 7:** 3DMark 2000.
- **Direct3D 8:** 3DMark 2001 SE, MapleStory v083.
- **Direct3D 9:** 3DMark06, KartRider, Warcraft III, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005).

## 7. Save and restore graphics state

Use `await emulator.save_state()` and `await emulator.restore_state(state)`.
The graphics checkpoint is stored in the snapshot as the `v86gl` device's
host state. The emulator pauses a running guest while saving or restoring, waits
for accepted GPU work and readbacks, and resumes it after success. Saves and
restores on the same instance are serialized. A failed restore leaves the guest
stopped. `initial_state` also restores graphics before `emulator-loaded`.
Historical graphics surfaces stay hidden during reconstruction; the final
surface is revealed after replay completes. Loading still takes time proportional
to the history. Browser audio is paused during the operation. Restoring clears
audio from the discarded timeline and reapplies the saved SB16 sampling rate
before playback resumes.

Checkpoint version 3 records OpenGL, Direct3D 8, Direct3D 9 and DirectDraw batches
in order, including Present and checkpoint flush boundaries. On restore the
adapter rebuilds clean executors and replays the history. This reconstructs
resource handles, shaders, render state, palettes, queries and GPU-rendered
contents, rather than relying only on CPU upload shadows. Historical readbacks
never write to the restored guest memory. D3D8 uses an owned back buffer so
unfinished frames survive browser frame boundaries and checkpoint flushes.

Commands are copied directly into contiguous pages, avoiding allocations per
batch. In browsers, completed page buffers are transferred to a dedicated
`graphics_journal_worker.js` worker for compression, keeping that work off the
emulation thread. Deploy this file beside `libv86-webgpu.js`; `make glbridge`
generates both. Environments without workers use local compression. There is no 512 MiB raw
history cutoff. `graphics_proxy: { graphicsJournalMemoryBytes }` sets the compressed
RAM cache budget (default 64 MiB); older `maxGraphicsJournalBytes` and
`maxGLJournalBytes` options are aliases for this budget. Excess pages are stored
temporarily in IndexedDB and deleted when the emulator resets or is destroyed.
If disk caching is unavailable or its quota is exhausted, pages stay in RAM;
commands are never discarded to enforce the cache budget. Pending compression
and the current page also use memory outside this cache budget.

Saving packs all pages into a portable checkpoint; loading needs no original
browser database. It decompresses and replays one page at a time. Saving still
needs memory for the complete output, and the emulator's overall state format
uses signed 32-bit offsets. History size and restore time grow with the recorded
workload. This remains a replay checkpoint, rather than a compact snapshot of
only live resources, and GPU results need the same supported features.

Snapshots from before `virtio_devices` (the device state of `v86gl_pci.js` in
`state[92]`) still restore: the device recognizes and converts them.

Version 2 checkpoints remain readable. A running session that already exceeded
the old history cutoff must be restarted with the new code: commands discarded
by the old implementation cannot be recovered.

Version 1 checkpoints can restore only their original OpenGL/D3D8 payloads.
They never stored D3D9/DirectDraw resources or GL query lifetimes, so missing
state in those old files cannot be recovered retroactively.

## Display

The guest desktop and the graphics proxy share one canvas. A WebGPU compositor
(`src/browser/glbridge/webgpu_compositor.js`) takes over the screen canvas:
the VGA/SVGA picture is one texture, and each OpenGL, Direct3D 8 and Direct3D 9
output (and each extra D3D9 swap chain) is a window layer placed where the
guest reports its window, clipped to its visible part. A window that is
hidden, minimised, or entirely covered by other windows (`D9WG_WINDOW_OCCLUDED`)
is not drawn, so a video or dialog the game shows in another window is visible;
one covered in part -- a message box, the Alt+Tab switcher -- is drawn only
where it shows (`D9WG_WINDOW_REGION`). Every proxy reports this (OpenGL through
the `WINDOW_STATE` control record), from WinEvent hooks rather than only on
Present, and being covered holds across Presents until the guest reports the
window uncovered.
If WebGPU cannot start, the screen falls back to a 2D canvas without the proxy.
Screenshots (`screen_make_screenshot`) read the composed picture. There is no
separate overlay canvas any more; see `docs/display-design.md`.

A canvas keeps the first kind of context it hands out. When the screen canvas
already went to the other kind -- an earlier emulator in the same container
drew on it in 2D or WebGPU, or WebGPU took it and then failed to start -- the
screen replaces it with a fresh copy (same attributes, same place). Listeners
the page attached to the old element do not move with it.

Regression checks:

```sh
make test-glbridge
make display-browser-tests
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_checkpoint_browser_test.html
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_vga_browser_test.html
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_journal_perf_test.html
```

The browser test checks actual GPU pixels for all four APIs after restoring in
both the same and a new emulator instance, including unfinished D3D8 drawing.
